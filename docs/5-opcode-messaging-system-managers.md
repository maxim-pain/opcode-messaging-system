**Key Concept**: Ensure resources are available for critical message flows.

1. **Bandwidth Reservation**
   - Reserve minimum bandwidth for each priority level
   - Implement admission control for new message flows
   - Support dynamic reallocation based on demand

2. **CPU Scheduling**
   - Coordinate thread priorities with message priorities
   - Implement priority-aware worker pools
   - Prevent processing bottlenecks

3. **Memory Management**
   - Pre-allocate buffers for high-priority messages
   - Implement separate memory pools per priority
   - Prevent high-priority queue starvation due to memory exhaustion

### 3.3 Congestion Management

**Key Concept**: Handle congestion gracefully to maintain system stability.

1. **Backpressure Mechanisms**
   - Implement end-to-end backpressure signals
   - Support push-back through multi-hop routes
   - Provide clear API indications for application-level handling

2. **Adaptive Rate Control**
   - Monitor queue depths to detect congestion
   - Implement AIMD (Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease) for rate control
   - Apply different rate control policies per priority

3. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Define message drop policies under extreme congestion
   - Preserve critical message flows during overload
   - Support quality reduction for streams (e.g., audio) instead of complete loss

## 4. Configuration Manager Best Practices

### 4.1 Configuration Validation

**Key Concept**: Ensure configuration integrity and correctness.

1. **Multi-level Validation**
   - Syntax validation (JSON schema, required fields)
   - Semantic validation (references, dependencies)
   - System constraint validation (resource limits, compatibility)

2. **Cross-reference Checking**
